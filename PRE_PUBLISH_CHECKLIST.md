## üìã Final Checks

### 1. Cargo.toml Metadata

Review and update if needed:

```toml
[package]
name = "helios-engine"
version = "0.1.0"  # or 0.1.1 if you've made changes

rust-version = "1.70"
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Verify repository URL is correct
- [ ] Verify homepage URL is correct
- [ ] Ensure description is accurate
- [ ] Check version number
- [ ] Confirm license is correct

### 2. Build and Test

```bash
# Clean build
cargo clean
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check for warnings
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all

# Build documentation
cargo doc --open

# Test examples
cargo run --example streaming_chat
cargo run --example direct_llm_usage
cargo run --example basic_chat
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Clean build succeeds
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No critical warnings
- [ ] Documentation builds correctly
- [ ] Examples run successfully

### 3. CLI Testing

```bash
# Test help
./target/release/helios-engine --help
./target/release/helios-engine init --help
./target/release/helios-engine chat --help
./target/release/helios-engine ask --help

# Test init
./target/release/helios-engine init --output test_config.toml

# Test with real API (if you have a key)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
./target/release/helios-engine ask "Hello, test message"
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Help text looks good
- [ ] Init command works
- [ ] Config file is created correctly
- [ ] CLI runs with real API

### 4. Documentation Review

Check all documentation files:

**Action Items:**
- [ ] README.md is clear and accurate
- [ ] USAGE.md covers all use cases
- [ ] docs/STREAMING.md explains streaming well
- [ ] docs/USING_AS_CRATE.md has correct examples
- [ ] PUBLISHING.md has accurate instructions
- [ ] All code examples compile
- [ ] No broken links

### 5. Package Check

```bash
# List files that will be included
cargo package --list

# Look for:
# - All necessary source files
# - Documentation files

```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] All necessary files included

- [ ] No sensitive data
- [ ] README.md is included
- [ ] LICENSE is included
- [ ] Examples are included

### 6. Dry Run

```bash
# Test the publishing process
cargo publish --dry-run

# This will:
# - Build the package
# - Check for errors
# - Verify it can be published
# - NOT actually publish
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Dry run succeeds
- [ ] No errors or warnings
- [ ] Package size is reasonable

### 7. Version Management

**Current version:** 0.1.0 (or check Cargo.toml)

**If publishing update:**
- Update version in Cargo.toml
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Create git tag

```bash
# If version changed
git add Cargo.toml CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Bump version to 0.1.1"
git tag v0.1.1
git push && git push --tags
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Version number is correct
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated
- [ ] Git tag created (if applicable)

### 8. Final Code Review

Quick sanity checks:

**Action Items:**
- [ ] No TODO comments in critical paths
- [ ] No debug println! statements
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Code is well-commented
- [ ] Public API is documented

## üöÄ Publishing Steps

Once all checks pass:

### Step 1: Login to crates.io

```bash
cargo login <your-api-token>
```

Get your token from: https://crates.io/me

### Step 2: Final Dry Run

```bash
cargo publish --dry-run
```

Review output carefully.

### Step 3: Publish!

```bash
cargo publish
```

### Step 4: Verify

1. Check https://crates.io/crates/helios-engine
2. Wait for docs to build at https://docs.rs/helios-engine
3. Test installation: `cargo install helios-engine`

## üì¢ Post-Publishing

### Announce

Consider announcing on:
- [ ] Reddit (r/rust)
- [ ] Twitter/X
- [ ] Rust Users Forum
- [ ] Discord communities
- [ ] Your blog/website

### Monitor

- [ ] Watch for issues on GitHub
- [ ] Check docs.rs build status
- [ ] Monitor download stats
- [ ] Respond to feedback

### Next Steps

- [ ] Plan next version features
- [ ] Address any issues found
- [ ] Update documentation as needed
- [ ] Consider adding more examples

## üìù Notes

**Package Name:** `helios-engine`
**Binary Name:** `helios-engine`
**Library Name:** `helios_engine`

**Installation:**
```bash
cargo install helios-engine
```

**Usage:**
```bash
helios-engine chat
helios-engine ask "question"
```

**Library:**
```toml
[dependencies]
helios-engine = "0.1.0"
```

```rust
use helios_engine::{LLMClient, ChatMessage};
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

1. **Cannot Un-Publish**: Once published to crates.io, you cannot delete the version (only yank it)
2. **Version Immutable**: Published versions cannot be modified
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Make sure everything works before publishing
4. **Documentation**: Good docs increase adoption
5. **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semver for version numbers

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### Published Wrong Version

```bash
# Yank the version (discouraged from use, but still installable)
cargo yank --vers 0.1.0

# Publish corrected version
# Update version in Cargo.toml
cargo publish
```

### Missing Files

- Cannot update the published version
- Must publish a new version with fixes

### Wrong Metadata

- Cannot change published metadata
- Must publish new version with corrections
